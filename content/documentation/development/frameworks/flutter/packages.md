## flutter_launcher_icons

> A command-line tool which simplifies the task of updating your Flutter app's launcher icon. Fully flexible, allowing you to choose what platform you wish to update the launcher icon for and if you want, the option to keep your old launcher icon in case you want to revert back sometime in the future.

Package: [flutter_launcher_icons](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_launcher_icons)

```yaml[pubspec.yaml]
flutter_icons:
  # image_path: "assets/images/icon-128x128.png"
  # image_path_android: "assets/images/icon-710x599-android.png"
  # image_path_ios: "assets/images/icon-710x599-ios.png"
  # android: true # can specify file name here e.g. "ic_launcher"
  # ios: true # can specify file name here e.g. "My-Launcher-Icon"
  # adaptive_icon_background: "assets/images/christmas-background.png" # only available for Android 8.0 devices and above
  # adaptive_icon_foreground: "assets/images/icon-foreground-432x432.png" # only available for Android 8.0 devices and above
  android: true
  ios: true
  image_path_android: "assets/images/android-icon.png"

```

## permission_handler

Package: [permission_handler](https://pub.dev/packages/permission_handler)

> On most operating systems, permissions aren't just granted to apps at install time. Rather, developers have to ask the user for permissions while the app is running.
>
> This plugin provides a cross-platform (iOS, Android) API to request permissions and check their status. You can also open the device's app settings so users can grant a permission.
> On Android, you can show a rationale for requesting a permission.

On iOS: <https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/21941>, check [this post on stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39519773/nsphotolibraryusagedescription-key-must-be-present-in-info-plist-to-use-camera-r/39519960#39519960)

In `Podfile`, you need to add all permissions you want to use because Apple will check this package which request all permissions even if you don't use in your application. Check list below and comment each permission you want to use.

```ruby[ios/Podfile]
# ...

post_install do |installer|
  installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|
    flutter_additional_ios_build_settings(target)
  end
end
```

```ruby[ios/Podfile]
# ...

post_install do |installer|
  installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|
    flutter_additional_ios_build_settings(target)
      target.build_configurations.each do |config|
      # Here are some configurations automatically generated by flutter

      # You can remove unused permissions here
      # for more infomation: https://github.com/BaseflowIT/flutter-permission-handler/blob/develop/permission_handler/ios/Classes/PermissionHandlerEnums.h
      # e.g. when you don't need camera permission, just add 'PERMISSION_CAMERA=0'
      config.build_settings['GCC_PREPROCESSOR_DEFINITIONS'] ||= [
        '$(inherited)',

        ## dart: PermissionGroup.calendar
        'PERMISSION_EVENTS=0',

        ## dart: PermissionGroup.reminders
        'PERMISSION_REMINDERS=0',

        ## dart: PermissionGroup.contacts
        'PERMISSION_CONTACTS=0',

        ## dart: PermissionGroup.camera
        'PERMISSION_CAMERA=0',

        ## dart: PermissionGroup.microphone
        'PERMISSION_MICROPHONE=0',

        ## dart: PermissionGroup.speech
        'PERMISSION_SPEECH_RECOGNIZER=0',

        ## dart: PermissionGroup.photos
        'PERMISSION_PHOTOS=0',

        ## dart: [PermissionGroup.location, PermissionGroup.locationAlways, PermissionGroup.locationWhenInUse]
        'PERMISSION_LOCATION=0',

        ## dart: PermissionGroup.notification
        # 'PERMISSION_NOTIFICATIONS=0',

        ## dart: PermissionGroup.mediaLibrary
        'PERMISSION_MEDIA_LIBRARY=0',

        ## dart: PermissionGroup.sensors
        'PERMISSION_SENSORS=0'
      ]
    end
  end
end
```

<alert>

Don't forget to detail permissions if you use them in `ios/Runner/Info.plist`
