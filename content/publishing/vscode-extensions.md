VSCode is one of the most popular and recognizable IDE for actually every programming language and in my own opinion — is the best. I tried to find the best extensions from many thousands and to show them to you. Some of them will help you with debugging your code, some of them will add many useful features and some of them will just make your code prettier and readable.

# [1\. Beautify](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HookyQR.beautify)

If you write your code right after the earlier without any spaces and tabs or maybe on the contrary write too many tabs that your code make bigger and bigger. **Beautify** will easily help you with any kind of problems with readable your code and so on. Everything that you need is: Press F1 and choose “Beautify file”. It will automatically fix what you want.

# [2\. Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)

If you work with Python that is the first extension that you should install, it allows you to run and debug your code right in the VSCode, you just need to press the button “Run and Debug” or to set up your own workflow to do it faster.

Python

# [3\. C/C++](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools)

The same thing as “Python” but already for C and C++. It also helps you to run and debug your code right at your VSCode and even uses AI that allows you to write your C/C++ code faster.

C/C++

# [4\. Bracket Pair Colorizer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoenraadS.bracket-pair-colorizer)

As you might have noticed from the title, it auto colorizes your brackets (doesn’t matter which ones, square brackets, or parentheses). It really helps you to read your code, because you don’t always know where the function ends or where you’ve forgotten to write parentheses and now it shows you an error.

# [5\. ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)

ESLint analyzes your JavaScript code to quickly find errors and also shows you what to write instead. When it defines an error it will have a red underscore and you can easily fix it yourself.

# [6\. Visual Studio IntelliCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VisualStudioExptTeam.vscodeintellicode)

If ESLint helps you to find errors in your JavaScript code, then Visual Studio IntelliCode helps you to find errors in your Python code. Also, a very useful extension that I use myself for many months

Visual Studio IntelliCode

# [7\. JavaScript (ES6) code snippets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=xabikos.JavaScriptSnippets)

My favorite extension for JavaScript. When you write something at your code and forget how calls function it will automatically offer you to write it down and you can just press Enter.

When you write your HTML, CSS, or JavaScript file you can press “Go Live” at the bottom of your VSCode window and it will automatically add your changes on a webpage without any reloads, etc.

# [11\. Path Intellisense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=christian-kohler.path-intellisense)

When we need to write a path at our “href” or “src” tags or in your Python file it will provide your a path to an already existing file.
