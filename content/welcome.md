<!-- ## Features -->

<list :items="features"></list>

I'm Web developer since 2018, I learn a lot about some different languages, frameworks, techs... And I needed to have some place to get more than snippets. I wanted to can write some article about concepts, with boiler plates and explications. But I would to have a beautiful interface and user friendly blocks of codes, easy to copy.

It's not really a documentation or a blog, it's curious mix between two. I update it regulary but I advice you to use information with caution, these can be not up to date.
