# Next Steps

With your newfound skills with Vue 3, PWAs, and IndexedDB, you might be wondering, “Where do I go from here?”

## The possibilities with IndexedDB

Well, the short answer is that a whole new world opens up to you with nearly limitless possibilities. After all, your newfound skills with IndexedDB aren’t limited to PWAs, you can leverage your new skills to add offline database capabilities to any other apps you’re building!

## What’s next in terms of PWAs?

The reality is that the world of PWAs is a pretty big one! Especially because as browsers become increasingly powerful and support on devices for these features grows, this means that the ecosystem is always evolving and features like push notifications are added to the abilities of PWAs.

That said, the learning doesn’t stop here! With your foundation skills, I encourage you to look into other frameworks like [NuxtJS](https://pwa.nuxtjs.org/) and [CapacitorJS](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/web/progressive-web-apps) which have support for PWAs with their own unique take on how they enhance the developer experience.

Thanks for taking this course with me, and I look forward to seeing what amazing PWAs you build for the ecosystem. Until next time!
