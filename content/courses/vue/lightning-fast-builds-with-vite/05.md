# Moving to Vite

If you have an existing Vue CLI project it’s relatively straightforward to move over. There are a few things to keep in mind.

## Env Variables

Vite exposes env variables on the `import.meta.env` global. Evan describes how to use this in the video, and you can read more in [this documentation](https://vitejs.dev/guide/env-and-mode.html).

## Require vs Import

When using webpack you might use `require` calls. In Vite we strongly recommend against `require`, because it’s technically a node.js concept and it won’t work well with Vite. However, if you’re using a depedency that uses `require` Vite will handle that.

## Require.contents

This is a feature of webpack that allows you to look at the files of a directory at runtime. Vite has an equivalent called [Glob Import](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html#glob-import), which you’ll want to use instead.
