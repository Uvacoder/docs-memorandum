## Why Memorandum ?

I'm Web developer since 2018, I learn a lot about some different languages, frameworks, techs... And I needed to have some place to get more than snippets. I wanted to can write some article about concepts, with boiler plates and explications. But I would to have a beautiful interface and user friendly blocks of codes, easy to copy. I try Vuepress, it was cool but when the goal is the create a really custom documentation, it's a little... tricky. When I discovered nuxt/content, I love it immediately because I love markdown and Tailwind CSS, so it's perfect.

It's not really a documentation or a blog, it's curious mix between two. I update it regulary but I advice you to use information with caution, these can be not up to date. If you find anything than can help you, you are welcome.
