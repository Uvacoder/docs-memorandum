# Getting Vite working with Vue

It’s pretty easy to get Vite working with Vue, and if you start a project with `$ npm init @vitejs/app` you can choose to have it setup automatically. However, it’s super easy to add framework support to a Vite project, and Evan demonstrates this in the video. Once this is working, the hot-module replacement should make it lightning fast to see changes.

Aside from running `npm run build` to build your Vue project before you deploy it, Vite also comes with the `npm run serve` command. This will run the Vite preview command which starts a production preview server. This is emulates a normal http server that serves only static assets from your `/dist` directory. The output and behavior should be the same between development and production.

Vite performs a great deal of build optimizations to get your application running fast in production. For more information on these, check out [the documentation](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html#build-optimizations). One of them is CSS code splitting, which Evan demonstrates in this video.
