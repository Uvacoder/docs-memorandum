In recent years, JavaScript has been developing very dynamically, and I do not mean libraries and frameworks. Staying up to date with what’s new is one thing; understanding the basics is another. This article aims not to explain but to point out and introduce the most important JavaScript concepts you should know. So, let’s dive in.

## 1\. Prototype

The first topic you should master is prototypes. Why? Because it is inherent in every object in JavaScript, and as you (probably) know, almost everything in JavaScript is an object.

What do prototypes give us? Imagine that you have many objects of the same class, and you need to add specific functionality to them. Instead of adding it to each instance separately, you add it directly to the prototype. Since the prototype is associated with each object, your problem is solved. Needless to say, this also has a positive effect on code performance.

In this topic, you need to understand what the prototype chain is. Once you get the hang of it, you will take your JavaScript knowledge to the next level.

## 2\. Scope

It might seem like scope is such a basic topic that it shouldn’t be on this list. However, I know from my own experience that fully understanding this mechanism is quite demanding and distinguishes good programmers from great ones.

First, let’s explain what a scope is. The scope is simply a set of rules for where and how variables are stored. It does sound easy, but at a basic level, it is not.

We often know quite intuitively when we have access to the indicated variable and when not. The problem arises when mechanisms such as hoisting or even the legendary closure come into play.

Understanding the scope is the best place to start getting a hang of the overall foundations of JavaScript. I mean things like the execution context and the call stack. You mustn't ignore the topic of scope, even if you are a novice programmer. It will make learning JavaScript easier for you.

## 3\. Classes (ES6)

One of the first very noticeable changes to JavaScript in recent years has been the introduction of classes. It is indeed only so-called syntactic sugar, and in fact, the classes in JavaScript are based on prototypal inheritance.

However, that doesn’t change the fact that classes are the third of five JavaScript topics whose knowledge I think you should have at your fingertips. You should learn about issues such as inheritance, encapsulation, and objects and instances. These are all the most important elements of the most popular programming paradigm: object-oriented programming.

It is for this reason that I believe understanding classes is so important.

However, at the same time, I recommend that you familiarize yourself with the other concepts of object-oriented programming, which is (in my opinion) also necessary to understand, for example, functional programming.

## 4\. Promise / Async / Await

You’ve probably heard that JavaScript is an asynchronous language. Anyway, what I wanted to write about is handling all kinds of asynchronous events, such as API queries.

JavaScript applications have to communicate with the server at almost 100% at some stage, and this is where asynchronous queries come into play. For a long time, we used the so-called callbacks, ie, functions that run when the query is completed. However, we currently have mechanisms such as promises and the async / await syntax.

To properly understand this topic, you need to know everything about async, API, and the mentioned mechanisms such as promises and async / await syntax and know at least the HTTP protocol basics and how the backend works.

## 5\. Patterns

Why design patterns? In simple terms, this is a way to “not reinvent the wheel.” The templates are designed to solve problems that most applications have. The ones you should pay special attention to are patterns such as:

* Module pattern
* Prototype pattern
* Observer pattern
* Singleton pattern

I hope that the above article has served its purpose and showed you where you should focus your eyes.
