## World traits

### Geysers

<spoiler>

```
SS Tier [Absolute best]
  Cool Slush Geyser
    + Source of water
    + Amazing heat sink (-10c)
    + High output volume

S Tier [Great]
  Polluted Water Vent
    + Source of water
    + Good heat sink (30c)
    + High output volume
    - Not slush
  Iron Volcano
    + Source of refined metal
    + Used for steel
    + Best source of heat (out of metals?)
    - Can get it from meteors
  Gold Volcano
    + Source of refined metal
    + Gold has Good thermal properties
    + Good source of heat

A Tier [Good]
  Minor Volcano
  Volcano
    + Good source of heat
  Copper Volcano
    + Source of refined metal
    + Good source of heat
    - No specialised uses like gold/iron

    - Lower volume than geysers
    - You always get 2 so any more just takes up a slot

    - You always get 2 so any more just takes up a slot
    - Late game boiling oil will massively outperform this

    - Can get from electrolisers

C Tier [Sad that it takes up a slot]
  Leaky Oil Fissure
    - Oil wells give far more output
  Steam Vent
