```bash
You need to correctly set up your flutter path.

from here https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/macos#update-your-path

    Determine the directory where you placed the Flutter SDK. You will need this in Step 3.
    Open (or create) $HOME/.bash_profile. You can do that by using terminal text editor by going in terminal and typing nano ~/.bash_profile

macOS Catalina uses the Z shell by default, so edit $HOME/.zshrc.

If you are using a different shell, the file path and filename will be different on your machine.

    Add the following line and change [PATH_TO_FLUTTER_GIT_DIRECTORY] to be the path where you cloned Flutterâ€™s git repo:

export PATH=[PATH_TO_FLUTTER_GIT_DIRECTORY]/flutter/bin:$PATH

for example:

export PATH=~/Documents/flutter/bin:$PATH

    press CTRL X and when it asked you to save the file, choose yes

    Run source $HOME/.bash_profile to refresh the current window or restart the terminal

    Verify that the flutter/bin directory is now in your PATH by running: echo $PATH

Notice that [PATH_TO_FLUTTER_GIT_DIRECTORY] is where you installed flutter SDK, not the location of your app

Instead of nano, you can use any text editor to edit ~/.bash_profile
```
